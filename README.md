# Bug-Squish-Game

Kill the cockroaches for points! (and cleanliness)<br/>
Kill all the roaches extra fast for extra points!<br/>
Cockroaches start getting faster as you squish their friends...<br/><br/>

HOW TO PLAY<br/>
Just open this link to play https://minhlongvu.github.io/Bug-Squish-Game/. Click on the roaches to squish them.<br/>
If that doesn't work, try opening the project folder in VS Code and use the Live-Server extension<br/>
or host it using any other method such as lite-server.<br/><br/>
